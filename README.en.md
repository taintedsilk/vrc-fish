## Overview

A small Windows tool that assists the VRChat fishing minigame by detecting key UI elements (OpenCV template matching / simple brightness-based detection) and controlling the minigame via <kbd>Left Mouse Button</kbd> press/release.

This repository currently focuses on the fishing logic, parameters, and experimental scripts for the **VRChat world FISHǃ**.

## Demo Video

3× speed:

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9490c80f-6a6e-45b1-b329-977a9c3e77ec" controls></video>

## Features

- Fully automated loop: cast → wait for bite → hook → control minigame → cleanup → next round
- Detection:
  - `matchTemplate`: bite prompt, minigame track, fish icon(s), slider template (fallback)
  - Brightness-based slider boundary detection on the track column (primary)
- Control: a lightweight physics model + MPC (Model Predictive Control) to decide hold/release
- Optional ML workflow: record data / inference mode + analysis & fitting scripts

## Target World

This project is mainly tuned for **FISHǃ**:
- World URL: https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_ae001ea3-ed05-42f0-adf2-3d47efd10a77
- World ID: `wrld_ae001ea3-ed05-42f0-adf2-3d47efd10a77`

Templates, thresholds, and ROIs are calibrated for the current UI of this world. If the world/UI updates, re-capture templates under `Resource-VRChat/` and adjust `config.ini`.

## Quick Start

1. In VRChat display/graphics settings, set the resolution to `1280×960` (matches the default templates in this repo).
2. Enter **FISHǃ** in VRChat, make sure you are ready to fish and the fishing UI is visible (do not cover it with other windows).
3. After casting, choose a position/view so that the bite indicator (the dot at the bottom of the exclamation mark) and the full minigame slider track are visible on screen (not cropped/occluded).
4. Adjust `config.ini` if needed (window matching, resolution, thresholds, cleanup parameters), then run `vrc-fish.exe`. If `is_pause=1`, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to pause/resume.

Notes:
- The project enables `RequireAdministrator` by default, so the app may require admin privileges.
- For stable template matching, the app can force VRChat client-area resolution via `force_resolution`.
- The app reads `config.ini` from the current working directory and loads templates from `resource_dir` (default `Resource-VRChat/`). Run it from the repo root, or copy `config.ini` and `Resource-VRChat/` next to the executable.

## Build

1. Open `vrc-fish.sln` with Visual Studio
2. Select `x64` + `Release` (or `Debug`)
3. Build `vrc-fish.exe`

Dependencies:
- OpenCV 4.6.0: headers/libs are organized under `include/` + `lib/`, and the runtime `opencv_*460.dll` should be placed next to the executable (the repo root already includes these DLLs).
- For VS Code, see `.vscode/tasks.json` (`Build Release`) and adjust paths for your local VS installation.
- Make sure the runtime can locate `config.ini` and `Resource-VRChat/` (set the working directory to the repo root, or copy required files to your output folder).

## Configuration

Config file: `config.ini` (the file contains inline comments, mainly in Chinese).

Key highlights:
- Window matching: `window_class`, `window_title_contains`
- Resolution: `force_resolution`, `target_width`, `target_height`
- Thresholds: `bite_threshold`, `minigame_threshold`, `fish_icon_threshold`, `slider_threshold`
- Multi-scale template matching: `fish_scale_*` (fish icons), `track_scale_*` (minigame track)
- Cleanup loop: `cleanup_*`, `cleanup_reel_key`
- ML: `ml_mode` (0=auto, 1=record, 2=infer), `ml_record_csv`, `ml_weights_file`
- Debug/log: `debug`, `debug_pic`, `debug_dir`, `vr_log_file`

Templates:
- Default directory: `Resource-VRChat/` (override via `tpl_*` keys)

## Logging & Debugging

- `debug=1`: prints scores, state transitions, and control info to the console
- `debug_pic=1`: saves key-frame screenshots under `debug_dir`
- `vr_log_file`: appends runtime logs to a file (see examples under `data/logs/`)

## Experimental Scripts (Optional)

Scripts live in `scripts/`:

- `fit_physics.py`: fit slider physics parameters from debug logs
- `analyze_log.py` / `analyze_oscillation.py`: analyze overshoot/oscillation behavior
- `train_bc.py`: behavior cloning training (requires `numpy`), outputs weights for `ml_mode=2`

## Project Layout

- `vrc-fish.cpp`: main app (capture, detection, state machine, control, cleanup)
- `config.ini`: configuration
- `Resource-VRChat/`: UI templates for FISHǃ
- `data/`: logs, sample data, ML weights
- `scripts/`: analysis / fitting / training utilities
